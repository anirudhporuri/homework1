What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Both merge and rebase are used to integrate changes from one branch into another
branch, but they do it in different ways. A merge will include all the changes from 
the main branch into the current branch as another commit, keeping both branches the 
exact same. A rebase will physically move the current branch to the tip of the main
branch, re-writing the project history by creating brand new commits for each 
commit in the original branch.

What is a remote repository? 
A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet.
It is useful especially for collaboratory purposes, since not everyone shares the
same device. It is also useful for backing up your project, and tracing file 
histories.
